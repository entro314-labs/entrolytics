/**
 * Entrolytics Client Authentication
 * 
 * Entrolytics uses Clerk for all authentication needs.
 * Client-side auth is handled automatically by Clerk's React components and hooks.
 * 
 * Use Clerk hooks for client-side auth state:
 * - useUser() - Get current user
 * - useAuth() - Get auth state and actions
 * - useSession() - Get session data
